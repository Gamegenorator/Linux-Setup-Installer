# My Linux Setup Installer
This is a simple installer script that I use when setting up a new Ubuntu Linux based system, This is primarily for me but feel free to use it or customize it however you'd like for your own purposes.

## Installs the Following:

- System Updates
- Git
- Snap
- Neofetch
- Htop
- Evolution Email Client
- Bitwarden Password Manager
- KeePassXC Password Manager
- BleachBit Disk Cleanner

- Atom Code Editor
- Sublime Text
- Sublime Merge
- NodeJS 12
  - npm
  - yarn

- Redux + React Redux

Currently **Only** runs on Ubuntu based systems, even when installing on a Debian based system NodeJS is likley to fail when installing.
